<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we implemented a mesh editor to perform mesh operations.
    The final product allows us to manually select edges and flip or split them,
    as well as upsample the mesh for a higher-resolution display.
</p>
<p>
    Before getting started on building the editor, we first
    built Bezier curves and surfaces by implementing de Casteljau's algorithm to 
    help us visualize and further understand the basic components upon which meshes are based.
    Then in the next section we started working with meshes. This section includes four parts: computing
    area-weighted vertex normals, edge flipping, edge splitting, and mesh upsampling.
    The first three parts are crucial to building the final part, which we can use
    to create a higher-resolution rendering. We implemented computation of area-weighted 
    vertex normals by traversing neighboring vertices of the current vertex, summing
    the appropriate cross products, and returning the normalized sum. Edge flipping
    and edge splitting both require hand-deriving the connections among edges,
    half-edges, vertices, and faces after the operations. The implementation is simply
    reassigning the pointers in the data structures accordingly. Finally, we implemented
    loop subdivision to allow upsampling of meshes. The following steps outline our
    implementation of loop subdivision: 1. compute new positions of original vertices, 2.
    compute positions of new vertices, 3. split edges, 4. flip any edge connecting
    an old vertex and a new vertex, 5. update all vertex positions.
</p>
<p>
    Through this project, we furthered our understanding of Bezier curves through visualization
    and of meshes through meticulously tracking all mesh elements in edge flipping and
    splitting. We especially gained better appreciation for the elegance of de Casteljau's
    algorithm and the half-edge data structure.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm is a method of evaluating Bezier curves. Bezier curves
    are paths traced by nestedly linearly interpolated (lerped) points moving along
    the line segment between two control points. Evaluating a Bezier curves means to
    mathematically model this path. To achieve this, de Casteljau's algorithm is a
    recursive algorithm that starts by linearly inperloating between every pair of adjacent
    control points, whose result is a set of new control points. Each control point
    is placed between the pair of points from which it is lerped, and another set of
    control points is generating by lerping every pair of adjacent control points in the
    new setup. This process is repeated until there is one point left. 
    
    In this part of the project, we implemented one step of de Casteljau's algorithm.
    This function takes in the most recently generated set of control points and returns
    the next set of control points. If the input only has one point (base case of 
    de Casteljau's algorithm), the function returns without computing any more points.
    If the size of the input array is not 1, which means the Bezier curve has not been
    fully evaluated, we compute the next set of points by linearly interpolating between
    each adjacent points in the input using the formula: $$(1 - t) * p_i + t * p_i+1$$
    where $t$ is an attribute of the BezierCurve instance.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm, which is used to evaluate Bezier curves can be extended
    to evaluate Bezier surfaces because Bezier surfaces are themselves extension of
    Bezier curves. Bezier surfaces consist of Bezier surface patches, each of which
    is defined by 4x4 control points. Each 4x1 control points define
    a Bezier curve in the u direction. Corresponding points on these 4 Bezier curves
    define 4 control points for the "moving curves" in the v direction.
    In this part, we first implemented the same function as in Part 1 for a Bezier patch,
    in which we evaluate the Bezier surface at one level. Next, we evaluated the patch
    at position (u,v) using the separable 1D de Casteljau's algorithm. For this,
    we first implemented a helper function to evaluate a vector of points in one direction.
    Then using this function, we evaluated the Bezier patch by first evaluating the patch
    in the u direction. Then for each of the resulting points, we evaluted the "moving curves"
    in the v direction.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    To compute the area-weighted average vertex normal, we first had to compute the areas
    of the vertex's neighboring triangles. The area of a triangle can be computed as the
    norm of the cross product between two adjacent vertices. Our implementation therefore
    traverses the vertex's neighboring points and sum the product of the norm of cross product
    between two adjacent points and the normal vector to the face associated with the vertex.
    This would be the area-weighted sum of normal vectors. We return this sum normalized, which
    would be the desired area-weighted average unit normal of the vertex.

    Using the averaged normals helped us achieve a smoother-looking surface. As demonstrated in the
    figure below.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    One of the operations that our mesh editor provides is edge-flip. After figuring
    out pictorially what the half-edges, edges, vertices, and faces should be connected
    after flipping, it is a straightforward implementation to reassign the pointers
    in each of the half-edge, edge, vertex, and face instances. In an edge-flip operation,
    there are 5 edges, 1 internal to be flipped and 4 external, 9 associated half-edges,
    4 vertices, and 2 faces. The figure below shows the correct assignment of all of
    the aforementioned data structures before and after an edge-flip.

<b>

</b>
<p>
    With one iteration of our code for Part 4, flipping the same edge multiple time
    resulted in some neighboring edge "disappearing," as shown in the figure below.
    By tracing the edge flips pictorially as well as looking carefully at our implementation,
    we found that this was because we had a typo and failed to update $e_3$ in our code. 
    Fixing this issue led to successful implementation.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Similar to edge-flip, an edge-split operation is a straightforward implementation
    after determining the correct relationships among all edges, half-edges, vertices,
    and faces after splitting. Below is a figure that represents the correct (re)assignment
    of pointers in all of these data structures.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Mesh upsampling helps us convert a coarse polygon mesh into a higher-resolution one.
    One mechanism to achieve mesh upsampling is loop subdivision, which is dividing each
    triangle into four smaller triangles. The positions of newly created vertices of the subdivided mesh 
    are assigned based on a weighting scheme illustrated in the figure below.
</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr align="center">
      <td>
        <img src="images/abcd.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption>Weighting Scheme for Assigning New Vertex Positions</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
    Our implementation follows the
    5 steps recommended in the project spec and starter code. We first iterated through all vertices of
    the input mesh, and used the loop subdivision algorithm to compute the new positions
    of the vertices. The positions of new vertices are computed using:
    $$ (1 - n * u) * v + u * sum $$
    where $n$ is the degree of the vertex, $v$ is the original position, $u$ is $3/16$ if $n == 3$
    and $3/(8n)$ otherwise, and $sum$ is the sum of original neighboring vertex positions.
    Each vertex is also marked as not new during the iteration, so as to ensure the
    edge-flip will work properly later on.

    Next, we computed the updated vertex positions with split edges, and store them
    as new positions for edges. These new positions are the positions of new vertices
    created when an edge is split, which is defined by:

    $$ (3/8) * (v_0 + v_1) + (1/8) * (v_2 + v_3) $$
    
    where $v_0$ and $v_1$ are the vertices incident with the edge currently iterated,
    and $v_2$ and $v_3$ are the two vertices on either side of the edge across the 
    two faces connected by the edge.

    Then we were ready to split the edges. We used the function splitEdge implemented
    in the previous part to perform the split-edge operation on any edge incident with
    two old vertices.

    We then flipped the new edges incident to one old and one new vertex to create
    the correct 4-1 subdivision.

    Finally, we copied the new vertex positions into Vertex::position for every vertex.
</p>

<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
  Loop subdivision rounds out sharp corners and edges. This effect can be reduced by
  pre-splitting some edges as illustrated in the figures below.

<p>
  As we can see in the figures above, the cube becomes asymmetric after repeated upsampling.
  This is because each side of the original cube mesh is asymmetrically divided by
  only one edge. We can solve this by splitting every edge that divides each side into two faces, such
  that each face is now divided into four congruent triangles. The rendered mesh
  with such pre-processing is shown below.
